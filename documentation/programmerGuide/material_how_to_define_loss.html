            <h1>Material how to define loss</h1>
            <p>
               For material definition there are params:
               <ul>
                   <li>Epsilon - relative electric permittivity (must be >=1)</li>
                   <li>Mue - relative magnetic permeability (must be >=1)</li>
                   <li>Kappa - electric conductivity (must be >=0)</li>
                   <li>Sigma - magnetic conductivity (non-physical property, must be >=0)</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
               Here is formula how to calculate Kappa from loss parameter which is normally in microwave RF called "tan(Delta)":
               <pre>
                    Kappa = atan(2*pi*f*tan(Delta))
                    pi = 3.14159265...
                    f = frequency at which tan(Delta) is required to have value as it have
                    tan(Delta) = material loss parameter which is provided by manufacturer
               </pre>
               As seen, tan(Delta) in openEMS for user defined material could be simulated on one frequency, for frequency dependent loss parameter or frequency dependent permitivity or permeability must be used lorentz or debeye material.
